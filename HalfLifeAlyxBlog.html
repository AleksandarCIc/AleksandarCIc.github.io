                <h2>How Half Life Alyx can save the VR industry</h2>
                <p id="plo">
                        Half life is one of the most criticly aclaimed PC games.It single handedly changed the whole PC shooter genre.It dilivered its game without any cutscenes and tried to make it as realistic
                        as posible with its gameplay elements.It was very succsefull.Then six years later Half Life 2 came out.It was developed by Valve's own engine Source,instead of using Gold Source that was a heavey modification of Quacke's 
                        enigne.It had amazing new technology.It had great graphics,great visuals and great gameplay.After its succses valve chose to make a seaquel called Half life:Aftermath,but was later changed to Half Life:Episode 1.
                        The game was shorter but still offered everything as Half Life 2.After that Half Life 2:Episode 2 was realsed,same story as Half Life:2 Episode.After that Valve cool off a bit and focus to realse the Orange Box.
                        After that they promised to make Half Life 2:Episode 3.Adter some time they promised that they are going to said they were making Half Life 2:Episode 3 to a fully fleged new game Half life 3.The fans were exited.After that
                        there were only delays and delays.and than nothing.Silence.Most of the employees that were working on Half life 3 were either laid off or theey abandoned Valve.Marc Laidlaw,the original writer for Half Life 2
                        has realsed Epistle 3,a letter that showed us how half life 3 was suppsoed to end.but starting in 2018 strange strings of data mentioning something called "HLVR" poped up in all valve's games.People thought it 
                        was a port of Half Life to VR,but nothing was comfermed.After that on November 21, 2019 a trailer was realsed.I suggest you view now before you continue reading this blog.
